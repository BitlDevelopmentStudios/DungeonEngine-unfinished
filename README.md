# DungeonEngine
A Text Adventure engine written in C# using .NET.

Meant as a base for DUNGEONBLADE II to be built on, this engine supports multiple languages and JSON files could be used to create objects. Due to development being focused on FIREFIGHT RELOADED ENDGAME and Novetus 2.0, DungeonEngine was scrapped and DUNGEONBLADE II was put on hold. Included is files for the engine, and scripts that would have been used in a Dungeonblade: Haunted Kingdom remake in the engine.
